         ‘My What-If Report’ allows you to simulate various what-if scenarios with different set of<br/> academic program, major, second major or minor that you may be planning to take. It<br/> looks at the current set of academic program(s),              plans you are taking and <br/>added/changed what-if program/plans, and it generates an overview of your degree<br/>  progress based on the modules that you have passed, currently reading and/or added <br/>what-if modules. 
<br/><br/>
On the other hand, ‘My Graduation Audit Report’ allows you to track your study<br/> progress and the graduation requirements that need to be fulfilled. It provides an <br/>overview of your eligibility to graduate based on the academic plans declared, and <br/>modules that you have passed and is available to all students pursuing a single or <br/>concurrent undergraduate degree.
